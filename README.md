### Rules :
- Clicking cards turns them around
- Randomly position the cards
- Readme, but that shouldn't even have to be said
- Explanation on the page itself
---
###  My to do list:
- [x] folder structure
- [x] find some images
## Js
- [x] create an array with img urls
- [x] double the array so you have each image twice
- [x] shuffle the array randomly and store its result in a new array
- [x] add a start button
- [x] create img elements
- [x] assign img urls in a loop and append them to the divs
- [x] take the display img codes out of event listener so that you can use it later
- [ ] write a function to append flip box into the divs
  - [x] first add all the page structure by js so that you can add levels and increase the number of cards
  - [x] add flip box classes to css then apply them to the divs in order
  - [ ] set a single image for all the card's front and show the main images on the back
  - [ ] make them turn by click
- [ ] make the images to be shown for 5s and then flip them back
## html
- [x] add bootstrap to your page
- [x] div divided to 16 blocks 4 col 4 row for each card
