### Rules :
- Clicking cards turns them around
- Randomly position the cards
- Readme, but that shouldn't even have to be said
- Explanation on the page itself

####  My to do list:
- [ ] folder structure
- [ ] find some images
- [ ] create an array with img urls
- [ ] double the array so you have each image twice
- [ ] shuffle the array randomly and store its result in a new array
